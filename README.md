# Algotrading_project
This a very early stage of my algo Trading project.
I had created a program to test my strategy using simple logic .
In this repo there is a dataframe called df.csv.
df.csv is stock price history of a indian company where i have created two extra column for entering the trade and exiting based on MACD strategy.
This df.csv is generated using a MACD strategy python program.
later I will also try to include the MACD strategy generating python program where I created the df.csv.
In this algotrading_tester.py ,the df dateframe is feeded.
This algotrading_tester.py program is not perfect and I have not given comments yet.
